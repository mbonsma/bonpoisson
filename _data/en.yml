    description: We are a group of physics trainees at the University of Toronto who work on various problems related to biophysics! What is biophysics? According to wikipedia - Biophysics is an interdisciplinary science that applies approaches and methods traditionally used in physics to study biological phenomena. Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, molecular biology, physical chemistry, physiology, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics, developmental biology and systems biology. The group is open to all interested members of the UofT community.
